## Overview

This project is a basic shell implemented in assembly language. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of system programming, such as handling user input, executing commands, and managing processes at a low level. The shell is designed to be simple and educational, making it a great starting point for understanding how operating systems and command-line interfaces work.
